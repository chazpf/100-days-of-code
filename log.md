# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started up this challenge by spending time today on the ShuffleUp project Mike and I are working on. I cloned and branched my first repository, and spun up a few initial lines of html css and javascript to start poking at the project.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I was able to manage the cloning/branching process, I was definitely a little anxious as this is my first collaboration. There are a lot of simple little things like connecting the stylesheet to the html, or creating a window.onload event handler that I'm glad to gain repetitions with, hopefully I'll stop pausing to recall them so often.

### Day 2: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I researched and solved an issue in the collaborative ShuffleUp project I'm working on with Mike. Debugging a few syntax issues, and learning more about the onClick html attribute.

**Thoughts:** Really fun to review code. I found it challenging to work through Mike's thought process, and rewarding to solve a bug.

### Day 3: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Lost some work I did refactoring Mike's discard function, and decided to shelve it until I could talk to him about it. Instead, I made a simple reset button for the project. 

**Thoughts:** I was frustrated today, trying to reformat some code and did something wrong between vscode and github, lost the work.  I need to solidify my understanding of checking out, switching between, and pushing to git branches.

### Day 4: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Really dug into the organization of the code for the ShuffleUp project. Moved around a few things, and broke up functions to more useful bites. Wrote a bit of new code that improved what I did yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I love organizing code. Hopefully I'm not stepping on my co-coder's toes at all, but it's in the spirit of refining and iterating.

### Day 5: March 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created some important data structures for the ShuffleUp program together with Mike today. We worked our way through creating the Deck and Card classes. We can now take a decklist, feed it to the Deck constructor function, and it will create a deck object and all the card objects needed to populate the deck.

**Thoughts:** Great session of peer programming with Mike. First time we really coding together on the same screen, and it was really helpful to bounce ideas off each other over the abstraction of these classes and objects.

### Day 6: March 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a text parser to take the user's decklist as input and convert it to the array structure needed for the deck object. Also integrated the new class structure we made yesterday with the rest of our codebase.

**Thoughts:** The first successful merge of the project, this was a momentous occasion. We worked on a seperate branch to expand the data structures and integrate them, and merge after testing that it worked as expected. Very rewarding.
