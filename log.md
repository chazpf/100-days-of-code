# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started up this challenge by spending time today on the ShuffleUp project Mike and I are working on. I cloned and branched my first repository, and spun up a few initial lines of html css and javascript to start poking at the project.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I was able to manage the cloning/branching process, I was definitely a little anxious as this is my first collaboration. There are a lot of simple little things like connecting the stylesheet to the html, or creating a window.onload event handler that I'm glad to gain repetitions with, hopefully I'll stop pausing to recall them so often.
